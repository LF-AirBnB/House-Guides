# 135 Pleasant Ave (2 bedroom)

## Parking

For the months of April - November, there is street parking only. Please see your host for specific spots that work with the neighbors. For the months of December - March, there is one spot off-street spot (it's a flower bed the  rest of the year). This is a compromise with the village which does not technically allow front yard parking.

## Entrance and Shoes

Please do not wear outdoor shoes in the apartment beyond the tiled entry area.

**Tip**: Keep a pair of flip flops near the door to take out the trash.

## Garbage and Recycling

**Garbage** pick up is **Monday** morning. If there is a holiday that week, the pick up shifts to **Tuesday** morning.

**Paper and cardboard** recycling goes in one of the two green bins in the courtyard. It's picked up on **Thursday** morning.  If there is a holiday that week, there is **no** cardboard/paper pick up.

**Other recyclables** (bottles and cans primarily) go in the *other* green bin. It's picked up on **Friday** morning.

The occupant of the main house, or your host, will take care of getting the bins to the street. The pick-up days listed above are for your reference, so you know the best times to get your trash and reycling out of the apartment.

**Note**: Plastic bags and plastic wrap ***cannot*** go in the green bins, but those materials can be dropped off in bins located at **ShopRite** and **Key Food**.

To check holidays and any other exceptions, please see the  [Pleasantville Sanitation Schedule](https://www.pleasantville-ny.gov/home/pages/sanitation-schedule-look)

## Laundry

Please use a small amount of detergent (about 1-2 tablespoons) in the washing machine. The detergent goes directly in with the clothes.

For the dryer, please be sure to ***clean the lint trap*** every load.

## Bathroom

**Bath and Shower**\
Rotate the larger handle to turn on the water. Rotate the smaller handle to adjust the temperature.

To enable the shower, turn on the water and then [pull out the diverter knob](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3iVL6_JK_n0?start=42&end=54).

**Toilet**\
Please do not flush things that [should go in the trash](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/press_releases/19-008pr.shtml#.YhR0J-jYqM8). That includes so-called flushable wipes. They cause sewer backups. Nobody wants that.

If the toilet does get clogged (it happens) correct plunging technique makes a big difference. There are lots of YouTube videos for that, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHZAb0_Qepg), although I would recommend a quicker rhythm than shown in that video.  Anyhow, if you're not *absolutely sure* about what you're doing, please message me and I'll come over and take care of it. I would much rather unclog a toilet than deal with a bigger mess like an overflow.

## Kitchen

- Always use the range hood when using the burners or oven. Do not wait for smoke to appear. Pollutants from combustion must be exhausted to outside to ensure that you are breathing clean air and ensure the CO/smoke detector does not sound an alarm.

- Please use plastic or wood utensils only with the non-stick cookware.

- Please use the provided cutting boards. Do not cut directly on the countertop or table.

- Do not place hot pots and pans directly on the countertop or table. Please use the provided cork trivets.

- Immediately wipe up any water spilled on the wood floors. Wood floors are easily damaged by water.

- Non-abrasive blue scrub pads are provided. Please do NOT use green scrub pads - they are abrasive.

- Please use the dishwasher. If you hand wash, please ensure water is not puddling on the counter or floor.

- [Do not put sharp knives in the dishwasher](https://www.thekitchn.com/this-is-what-a-dishwasher-actually-does-to-your-knife-235242).

- [Do not put non-stick cookware in the dishwasher](https://www.tastingtable.com/857241/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-put-nonstick-cookware-in-the-dishwasher/).

- The Keurig coffee machine water tank is removable for refilling. It can also can be used without a pod to get hot water for tea.

- Put waste cooking oil, grease, and fat in the trash, not down the drain.\
**Tip**: Keep a waste container for grease in the freezer.


## Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarms

There are three alarm units in the apartment. Two are smoke-only detectors in the bedrooms. The other is a smoke/CO detector in the living room.

To reduce the chance of nuisance alarms, **always** use the **range hood** when cooking and do not leave anything cooking unattended in/on the range, oven, microwave, or toaster.

If a nuisance alarm is triggered in the apartment, you can hush the alarm by pressing the big center button on the unit that got triggered. If you can't reach the button, use a broom handle or wooden spoon handle to press it.

Please note that smoke detectors are actually just particle detectors. Dust in the air will set them off. It has been our experience that for longer stays, there are usually no dust-triggered alarms in the first month or two of a stay, as we start the rental with the unit meticulously clean. However, once interior dust levels significantly increase after a month or two, false alarms may begin. If this happens, I will stop by and blow air through the alarms, but it is up to the guest to vaccuum thoroughly to prevent continued false alarms.

## Heating and Cooling

### Heating

The apartment has baseboard hot-water radiant heating. There's a single thermostat in the living room. To adjust the temperature, press the up or down arrow buttons and then just leave it. Do not press the center button.

If there is any issue with the heat, please contact me.

### Cooling

The apartment is cooled via a [ductless air-source heat pump (a.k.a. mini-split)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKPAaOZhA_Q). There is one cooling wall unit in the main bedroom, with a remote control located in a holster below the unit.

**IMPORTANT**: leave the bedroom doors open, as much as possible, to allow the cool air to circulate.

**IMPORTANT**: When adjusting the temperature, using the remote control, you must hear a **beep** from the unit, otherwise your adjustment is not registered (i.e. ***no beep, no change***).

**Note**: It's very helpful to understand that the temperature sensor is in the wall unit, and not in the remote control. This means that sometimes you may need to set the temperature lower than your desired temperature until the entire space is cool, as the space immediately around the unit is going to reach the set temperature sooner than the rest of the space.

**Note**: If the remote control stops working, or gets difficult to use, it may just need new batteries. Please contact me and I will change the batteries.

**Note**: The ductless unit will be completely powered off during cold weather, since the radiant heating will be used when heat is needed.


## Vacuum Cleaner

There's a vaccum cleaner located in the main bedroom closet.


## Cleaning

First, do no harm! Some marks and stains are best left for your host to deal with.

Do not bring abrasive powder cleansers, steel wool or other abrasive scrub pads into the house. Blue and white scrub pads are fine. Those "heavy duty" ones, that are usually green, are very abrasive and cause scratches.

Damp wiping, sometimes with a bit of liquid detergent or a general purpose cleaner, is usually all that's needed.

[Liquid Barkeeper's Friend](https://barkeepersfriend.com/products/soft-cleanser/) (shake well) and a blue scrub pad work well for cleaning the range top and steel pots and pans (but not non-stick cookware).

Toilets do not need heavy duty cleansers. They are a smooth surface, so they clean up nicely with the toilet brush and a bit of liquid soap, bodywash, or shampoo.

Painted walls can be wiped with a damp rag. Do not use Windex or other general purpose cleaners on painted walls. They usually do more harm than good (i.e. they may cause a shiny area). Leave difficult marks for your host to remove.

## WIFI

**Garibaldi** or **Garibalid_5G** with password **good4you**

## TV

The living room TV has Google TV and the bedroom TV has Roku. The primary TV has a single remote control for all funcitions. The bedroom TV has a Roku remote for all functions with volume control buttons on the side.

**Tip**: If the TV is on and nothing is displayed, press the **Home** button on the remote.

**Note**: If the remote control stops working, or gets difficult to use, it may just need new batteries. Please contact me and I will change the batteries.

**Live TV** (i.e. traditional TV) is under the **Sling** icon. Open Sling and then select **Guide** from the side icons.

Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Discovery+, and Sling should all be logged in with my account, ready to use. Please message me if you can't get access. ABC, NBC and FOX are under Sling. Our Amazon Prime account includes Britbox, Acorn, PBS Masterpiece, and PBS Living. Discovery+ includes HGTV and Nature documentaries.

If there is something you want to watch and it does not appear to be on any of our services, please let me know and I'll see if I can set it up for you.

If you have any trouble with the TVs, please do not fiddle with the cables or install/reinstall apps. Contact me and I will sort it out.

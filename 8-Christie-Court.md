# 8 Christie

## Parking

The main parking is on the pavers at the **left** side of the house. Two cars can fit there side by side. There are two additional guest gravel spots; one at the front of the house and another in the center of the Christie Court turnaround.

## Entrance and Shoes

Please do not wear outdoor shoes in the house beyond the tiled entry area.

**Tip**: Keep a pair of flip flops near the door to take out the trash.

## Garbage and Recycling

**Garbage** pick up is **Wednesday** morning. If there is a holiday that week, the pick up shifts to **Thursday** morning.

**Paper and cardboard** recycling goes in one of the green bins. It's picked up on **Thursday** morning.  If there is a holiday that week, there is **no** cardboard/paper pick up.

**Other recyclables** (bottles and cans primarily) go in the *other* green bin. It's picked up on **Friday** morning.

The garbage can and Friday recycling will usually get picked up from where the bins sits beside the house, but, to be sure, move it to where the pavers meet the asphalt.

The Thursday recycling (paper and cardboard) must be placed in the common spot for Christie Court. You'll see the pile out front.

**Note**: Plastic bags and plastic wrap ***cannot*** go in the green bins, but those materials can be dropped off in bins located at **ShopRite** and **Key Food**.

To check holidays and any other exceptions, please see the  [Pleasantville Sanitation Schedule](https://www.pleasantville-ny.gov/home/pages/sanitation-schedule-look)

## Laundry

Please use a tiny amount of detergent (about 1-2 tablespoons) in the washing machine. It's an HE (high efficiency) machine and will run an ***extra long time*** to clear suds if you use too much detergent.

**IMPORTANT**: When the clothes washer is *not in use*, do NOT close the door all the way. Use the first catch, which leaves it slightly ajar. This allows it to air out between uses which prevents ***stinky bacteria growth*** in the machine.

For the dryer, please be sure to ***clean the lint trap*** every load.

## Main Bathroom

**Bath and Shower**\
Rotate the larger handle to turn on the water. Rotate the smaller handle to adjust the temperature.
To enable the shower, turn on the water and then [pull out the diverter knob](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3iVL6_JK_n0?start=42&end=54).

**Toilet**\
Please do not flush things that [should go in the trash](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/press_releases/19-008pr.shtml#.YhR0J-jYqM8). That includes so-called flushable wipes. They cause sewer backups. Nobody wants that.

If the toilet does get clogged (it happens) correct plunging technique makes a big difference. There are lots of YouTube videos for that, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHZAb0_Qepg), although I would recommend a quicker rhythm than shown in that video.  Anyhow, if you're not *absolutely sure* about what you're doing, please message me and I'll come over and take care of it. I would much rather unclog a toilet than deal with a bigger mess like an overflow.

## Downstairs Bathroom

Too much toilet paper will clog the downstairs [Saniflo toilet](https://www.saniflo.com/us/home/74-sanicompact.html). Use a small amount of toilet paper per flush. Don't worry about wasting water. If it does get clogged, **do NOT attempt to plunge it**, as that can damage the unit. Instead, run the water in the sink beside the toilet. That sink drains into the toilet macerator which then ejects it into the sewer line. As long as nothing is overflowing, let the water run for several eject cycles and that should clear the clog. If not, call or message me and I'll take care of it.

## Kitchen

- Always use the range hood when using the burners or oven. Do not wait for smoke to appear. Pollutants from combustion must be exhausted to outside to ensure that you are breathing clean air and ensure the CO/smoke detector does not sound an alarm.

- Please use plastic or wood utensils only with the non-stick cookware.

- Please use the provided cutting boards. Do not cut directly on the countertops.

- Do not place hot pots and pans directly on countertops. Please use the provided cork trivets.

- Immediately wipe up drips and spills from the wood island top. Otherwise, black stains will appear.

- Non-abrasive blue scrub pads are provided. Please do not use green scrub pads - they are abrasive.

- The dishwasher has a third tray, right at the top, for utensils.

- [Do not put sharp knives in the dishwasher](https://www.thekitchn.com/this-is-what-a-dishwasher-actually-does-to-your-knife-235242).

- [Do not put non-stick cookware in the dishwasher](https://www.tastingtable.com/857241/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-put-nonstick-cookware-in-the-dishwasher/).

- The Keurig coffee machine water tank is removable for refilling. It can also can be used without a pod to get hot water for tea.

- Put waste cooking oil, grease, and fat in the trash, not down the drain.\
**Tip**: Keep a waste container for grease in the freezer.


## Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarms

There are four alarm units in the house. The ones located within the two bedrooms are smoke-only detectors. The other two, outside the bedrooms, are smoke/CO detectors.

To reduce the chance of nuisance alarms, **always** use the **range hood** when cooking and do not leave anything cooking unattended in/on the range, oven, microwave, or toaster.

If a nuisance alarm is triggered, you can hush the alarm by pressing the big center button on the unit that got triggered (it should be blinking red). Unless you are very tall, you won't be able to reach the button with your hand. Use the broom (handle end), located in the entry closet, to push the button.

Please note that smoke detectors are actually just particle detectors. Dust in the air will set them off. It has been our experience that for longer stays, there are usually no dust-triggered alarms in the first month or two of a stay, as we start the rental with the unit meticulously clean. However, once interior dust levels significantly increase after a month or two, false alarms may begin. If this happens, I will stop by and blow air through the alarms, but it is up to the guest to vaccuum thoroughly to prevent continued false alarms.

## Heating and Cooling

The main floor is heated and cooled via a [ductless air-source heat pump (a.k.a. mini-split)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKPAaOZhA_Q). There is one heating/cooling wall unit in the living room and one in the bedroom, with a remote control for each located in a holster near the unit.

**Note**: Either remote control will operate either unit, but it's less confusing to leave the remotes in their holsters and not mix them up. The remote control may work from the holster, but it's more reliable to hold it and point it at the wall unit.

**IMPORTANT**: When adjusting the temperature, using the remote control, you must hear a **beep** from the unit, otherwise your adjustment is not registered (i.e. ***no beep, no change***).

There is a ***mode*** button under the sliding cover of the remote control to select **heat (☼)** or **cool (❄)** mode. The two inside units share one outside unit, so it is necessary that both inside units be in the **same mode**. It also works most efficiently to keep the temperature setting for each room pretty similar.

**Note**: It's very helpful to understand that the temperature sensor is in the wall unit, and not in the remote control. This means that sometimes you may need to set the temperature a little bit beyond your desired temperature (higher for heat, lower for cooling) ***for a while*** until the entire space is at the desired temperature, as the space immediately around the unit is going to reach the temperature set on the remote control a little sooner than the rest of the space.

**Note**: If either remote control stops working, or gets difficult to use, it may just need new batteries. Please contact me and I will change the batteries.

## Downstairs Heat

The furnace for downstairs is in the laundry area. Just turn the temperature up or down as desired. The fan in the downstairs bedroom wall comes on when the furnace is running. There is no cooling system for downstairs, as it stays naturally cool in the summer.

## Downstairs Bedroom

The sofa converts to a double bed. A foam mattress topper, mattress pad, sheets, pillows, and a comforter are in the closet in the same room.

## Vacuum Cleaner

There's a vaccum cleaner located behind the curtain in the laundry/utility room.

## Cleaning

First, do no harm! Some marks and stains are best left for your host to deal with.

Do not bring abrasive powder cleansers, steel wool or other abrasive scrub pads into the house. Blue and white scrub pads are fine. Those "heavy duty" ones, that are usually green, are very abrasive.

Damp wiping, sometimes with a bit of liquid detergent or a general purpose cleaner, is usually all that's needed.

[Liquid Barkeeper's Friend](https://barkeepersfriend.com/products/soft-cleanser/) (shake well) and a blue scrub pad work well for cleaning the range top around the burners, cleaning steel pots and pans (but not non-stick cookware), and removing stains from the quartz countertops.

Toilets do not need heavy duty cleansers. They are a smooth surface, so they clean up nicely with the toilet brush and a bit of liquid soap, bodywash, or shampoo.

Painted walls can be wiped with a damp rag. Do not use Windex or other general purpose cleaners on painted walls. They usually do more harm than good (i.e. they may cause a shiny area). Leave difficult marks for your host to remove.

## WIFI

**Whistler** or **Whistler_5G** with password **good4you**

## TV

There is a single remote control for each TV that you can use to turn on the TV, adjust the volume, and navigate the various streaming services provided via the **Roku** interface.

**Tip**: If the TV is on and nothing is displayed, press the **Home** button on the remote.

**Tip**: The audio system should *just work*, but sometimes curious little fingers press the buttons and mess things up. If there is no sound, ensure that the audio system is powered on and set to **Aux** for upstairs and **TV** downstairs.

**Note**: If the remote control stops working, or gets difficult to use, it may just need new batteries. Please contact me and I will change the batteries.

**Live TV** (i.e. traditional TV) is under the **Sling** icon. Open Sling and then select **Guide** from the side icons.

# 22 Cooley (1 bedroom)

## Parking

Please park on the **right** side of the driveway. Guests can park directly behind your car. Up to three cars will fit end to end if you pull all the way up.

## Entrance and Shoes

Please do not wear outdoor shoes in the apartment beyond the tiled entry area.

**Tip**: Keep a pair of flip flops near the door to take out the trash.


## Garbage and Recycling

**Garbage** pick up is **Monday** morning. If there is a holiday that week, the pick up shifts to **Tuesday** morning.

**Paper and cardboard** recycling goes in one of the green bins under the porch. It's picked up on **Thursday** morning.  If there is a holiday that week, there is **no** cardboard/paper pick up.

**Other recyclables** (bottles and cans primarily) go in the *other* green bin. It's picked up on **Friday** morning.

The garbage can or green bin has to be at the ***end of the driveway*** to get picked up. Take extra care to retrieve the garbage can or recycling bin promptly after pick up, as wind and the sloped driveway and street tend to take them away. If it is very windy, please do not put out the green recycling bins. In that case, I will pick it up on Saturday and take it directly to the recycling center.

**Note**: Plastic bags and plastic wrap ***cannot*** go in the green bins, but those materials can be dropped off in bins located at **ShopRite** and **Key Food**.

To check holidays and any other exceptions, please see the  [Pleasantville Sanitation Schedule](https://www.pleasantville-ny.gov/home/pages/sanitation-schedule-look)

## Laundry

Please use a tiny amount of detergent (about 1-2 tablespoons) in the washing machine. It's an HE (high efficiency) machine and will run an ***extra long time*** to clear suds if you use too much detergent.

**IMPORTANT**: When the clothes washer is *not in use*, do NOT close the door all the way. Use the first catch, which leaves it slightly ajar. This allows it to air out between uses which prevents ***stinky bacteria growth*** in the machine.

For the dryer, please be sure to ***clean the lint trap*** every load.

## Bathroom

**Bath and Shower**\
Rotate the larger handle to turn on the water. Rotate the smaller handle to adjust the temperature.
To enable the shower, turn on the water and then [pull down on the tub spout **lip**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxWnSeDC2tY).

**Toilet**\
Please do not flush things that [should go in the trash](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/press_releases/19-008pr.shtml#.YhR0J-jYqM8). That includes so-called flushable wipes. They cause sewer backups. Nobody wants that.

If the toilet does get clogged (it happens) correct plunging technique makes a big difference. There are lots of YouTube videos for that, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHZAb0_Qepg), although I would recommend a quicker rhythm than shown in that video.  Anyhow, if you're not *absolutely sure* about what you're doing, please message me and I'll come over and take care of it. I would much rather unclog a toilet than deal with a bigger mess like an overflow.

## Kitchen

- Always use the range hood when using the burners or oven. Do not wait for smoke to appear. Pollutants from combustion must be exhausted to outside to ensure that you are breathing clean air and ensure the CO/smoke detector does not sound an alarm.

- Please use plastic or wood utensils only with the non-stick cookware.

- Please use the provided cutting boards. Do not cut directly on the wood countertops.

- Do not place hot pots and pans directly on countertops. Please use the provided cork trivets.

- Immediately wipe up drips and spills from the wood countertops. Otherwise, black stains will appear.

- Non-abrasive blue scrub pads are provided. Please do not use green scrub pads - they are abrasive.

- Please use the dishwasher instead of hand washing to keep water away from the wood countertops. If you hand wash, please ensure water is not under the drying rack.

- The dishwasher has a third tray, right at the top, for utensils.

- [Do not put sharp knives in the dishwasher](https://www.thekitchn.com/this-is-what-a-dishwasher-actually-does-to-your-knife-235242).

- [Do not put non-stick cookware in the dishwasher](https://www.tastingtable.com/857241/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-put-nonstick-cookware-in-the-dishwasher/).

- The Keurig coffee machine water tank is removable for refilling. It can also can be used without a pod to get hot water for tea.

- Put waste cooking oil, grease, and fat in the trash, not down the drain.\
**Tip**: Keep a waste container for grease in the freezer.


## Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarms

There are two alarm units in the apartment. One is a smoke-only detector in the bedroom. The other is a smoke/CO detector outside of the bedroom.

To reduce the chance of nuisance alarms, **always** use the **range hood** when cooking and do not leave anything cooking unattended in/on the range, oven, microwave, or toaster.

If a nuisance alarm is triggered in the apartment, you can hush the alarm by pressing the big center button on the unit that got triggered. If you can't reach the button, use a broom handle or wooden spoon handle to press it.

Please note that smoke detectors are actually just particle detectors. Dust in the air will set them off. It has been our experience that for longer stays, there are usually no dust-triggered alarms in the first month or two of a stay, as we start the rental with the unit meticulously clean. However, once interior dust levels significantly increase after a month or two, false alarms may begin. If this happens, I will stop by and blow air through the alarms, but it is up to the guest to vaccuum thoroughly to prevent continued false alarms.

## Heating and Cooling

The apartment is heated and cooled via a [ductless air-source heat pump (a.k.a. mini-split)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKPAaOZhA_Q). There is one heating/cooling wall unit in the living room and one in the bedroom, with a remote control for each located in a holster near the unit.

**Note**: Either remote control will operate either unit, but it's less confusing to leave the remotes in their holsters and not mix them up. The remote control should work properly without removing it from its holster, but it's also fine to hold it.

**IMPORTANT**: When adjusting the temperature, using the remote control, you must hear a **beep** from the unit, otherwise your adjustment is not registered (i.e. ***no beep, no change***).

There is a ***mode*** button under the sliding cover of the remote control to select **heat** or **cool** mode. The system works most efficiently when the temperature setting for each room is pretty similar.

**Note**: It's very helpful to understand that the temperature sensor is in the wall unit, and not in the remote control. This means that sometimes you may need to set the temperature a little bit beyond your desired temperature (higher for heat, lower for cooling) ***for a while*** until the entire space is at the desired temperature, as the space immediately around the unit is going to reach the temperature set on the remote control a little sooner than the rest of the space.

**Note**: If either remote control stops working, or gets difficult to use, it may just need new batteries. Please contact me and I will change the batteries.

## Vacuum Cleaner

The apartment has a built-in vacuum that is shared with the upstairs apartment. To use it, just plug in the hose in the outlet located in the living room, being careful to align the tab on the hose with the tab spot on the inlet. That will allow you to use the switch on the hose to turn it on and off.

Please avoid using the vacuum when it's already in use in the upstairs apartment (you will be able to hear it) as that will reduce suction by half for both units. Also, do not leave the hose attached to the inlet, when not in use, for the same reason.


## Cleaning

First, do no harm! Some marks and stains are best left for your host to deal with.

Do not bring abrasive powder cleansers, steel wool or other abrasive scrub pads into the house. Blue and white scrub pads are fine. Those "heavy duty" ones, that are usually green, are very abrasive.

Damp wiping, sometimes with a bit of liquid detergent or a general purpose cleaner, is usually all that's needed.

[Liquid Barkeeper's Friend](https://barkeepersfriend.com/products/soft-cleanser/) (shake well) and a blue scrub pad work well for cleaning the range top around the burners, cleaning steel pots and pans (but not non-stick cookware), and removing stains from the quartz countertops.

Toilets do not need heavy duty cleansers. They are a smooth surface, so they clean up nicely with the toilet brush and a bit of liquid soap, bodywash, or shampoo.

Painted walls can be wiped with a damp rag. Do not use Windex or other general purpose cleaners on painted walls. They usually do more harm than good (i.e. they may cause a shiny area). Leave difficult marks for your host to remove.

## WIFI

**Garibaldi** or **Garibalid_5G** with password **good4you**

## TV

The primary remote control is the white Chromecast remote. Use it to turn on the TV (lower-left button), adjust the volume (side buttons), and navigate the various streaming services.

**Tip**: If the TV is on and nothing is displayed, press the **Home** button on the Chromecast remote.

**Tip**: Press the volume up or volume down button on the side of the Chromecast remote and verify that the volume level is displayed on the front of the audio system (the big black box sitting under the TV). If nothing is displayed on that box, it may be off. Use the separate black Sony remote control to turn the audio system on.

**Note**: If the remote control stops working, or gets difficult to use, it may just need new batteries. Please contact me and I will change the batteries.

**Live TV** (i.e. traditional TV) is under the **Sling** icon. Open Sling and then select **Guide** from the side icons.

Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Discovery+, and Sling should all be logged in with my account, ready to use. Please message me if you can't get access. ABC, NBC and FOX are under Sling. Our Amazon Prime account includes Britbox, Acorn, PBS Masterpiece, and PBS Living. Discovery+ includes HGTV and Nature documentaries.

If you have any trouble with the TVs, please do not fiddle with the cables or install/reinstall apps. Contact me and I will sort it out.
